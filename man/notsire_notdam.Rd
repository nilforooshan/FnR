\usage{
notsire_notdam(ped, notsire, notdam)
}
\arguments{
\item{ped}{: A data frame with integer columns corresponding to ID, SIRE, and DAM. IDs should be sequential, starting from 1. Missing parents (SIRE and DAM) are denoted as 0.}

\item{notsire}{: A set of individual IDs that cannot be found among \code{ped$SIRE}.}

\item{notdam}{: A set of individual IDs (distinct from \code{notsire}) that cannot be found among \code{ped$DAM}.}
}
\value{
: Numerator relationship coefficients between \code{notsire} and \code{notdam} individuals in the form of a matrix.
